# numeracy app

the contents of this readme is meant to give a comprehensive and detailed explation of the technical aspects of this app "numeracy".
It'll include architecture, data types, data flow, state, state change etc.

This is done for some possible reasons:

- As the app grows, it'll become harder to track. This documentation is mean to both be a grounded state of refrence of the app, and meant to track the app as it grows.
- In the event that the app is sold or transferred, it becomes easy for the new devs to understand the process that made the app
- This documentation is also meant for me, the creator of this app. Prime infinity itself to know what i did, why i did what i did and what not

## Overall App explanation

In it's oversimplified form, this app basically delivers math questions to the users, the app also delivers 4 options that the users can then pick from, of which one is the right answer.
In the stage one of it's MVP(which i'm writing this from), the app generates these questions and options with codes within the app itself.
